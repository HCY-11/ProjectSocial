# Installation

Click on the "code" button and then hit "download zip"

Extract the files onto a folder of your choice

Then, go into the Build/ folder, then the folder with the name of your platform. Once in this directory, click the .exe/.x86_64 file to run it.

On Windows, a dialog box may pop up as a warning. Click on "more options" and "Run Anyway."

The screen should say "Status Text" and then "CONNECTED." Once a game session has been found for you, the screen will say "STARTED." Then, the
first player to hit the "W" key will win. An appropriate dialog will show up then.

To join another game, restart the program (hit Alt+F4 to exit?)
